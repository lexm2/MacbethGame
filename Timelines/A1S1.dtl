"Second Witch": Paddock calls.
"First Witch": When shall we three meet again â€”\
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
"Second Witch": When the hurlyburly's done,\
When the battle's lost, and won.
"Third Witch": That will be ere the set of sun.
"First Witch": Where the place?
"Second Witch": Upon the heath.
"Third Witch": There to meet with Macbeth.
"First Witch": I come, Graymalkin.
"Third Witch": Anon.
All: Fair is foul, and foul is fair.\
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
